# Simple-Regression-Colab

Regression example. First time using Google colab, which turned out to be another nice notebook option.
This notebook makes use of scikit libraries, as well as the pandas library in order to create a regression
model using a dataset. Random forest is also used later to compare which method is more accurate.
